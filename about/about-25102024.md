Hello, there!

I’m Ibrohim Abdivokhidov.

I do Computer Science at New Uzbekistan University.

I’m focused on a wide range of research areas including;

Neuroscience and Bioinformatics,

Robotics and Artificial Intelligence,

Quantum Computing and Blockchain.

Currently, I am doing research on optimizing AlphaFold using Quantum computing. Specifically, the Matrix Multiplication part, manipulating with Quantum gates. So, it will not only accelerate AlphaFold alone, however other applications where Matrix Multiplication applied.

(Back to AlphaFold. It uses traditional matrix multiplication “tf.linalg.matmul” from Tensorflow.)

I do hackathons, build AI-powered projects.

A little fact about me, I love Croissants and Music.

In the past, as an Undergraduate research assistant, I authored a paper on Machine Learning. Published by Springer and Scopus indexed, ICSDI 2024. Also, I have 5 more papers under review.

Then, I got an offer from Souk, an Algerian e-commerce startup. There, I worked for roughly 9 months as a Mobile developer.

I also worked as an AI Research intern at Dugree. My team did research on over 30 papers. We mostly focused on; “Human-AI collaboration for toughest political discussions”.

Recently, I presented my paper at the DKU 2024 conference. It was about; “Enhancing trade and investment patterns in Central Asia using AI”. The interesting stuff is, there were only Ph.D. and Masters students.

I am an Open Source contributor at Anarchy Labs (over 477 stars on Github), Langflow (over 31,200 stars on Github).

I participated in over 60 hackathons and built over 60 projects.

All of them Open Source.

10 of them are startups, because there is a little traction at least.

I won over 6 hackathons.

Later on I founded Open Community. We build AI-powered Open Source tools and projects using AI.

At present, I am the 1st AI/ML API Regional Ambassador in Central Asia. There, I help developers to integrate AI tools to their workflows.

So far, I mentored over 200,000 developers including youth.

and umm…. yeah that’s about me in short.
