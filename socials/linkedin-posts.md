[posted on approx. 30th October]

I’m ranked as the #1 Undergraduate student whose Research Paper published by Springer Nature and indexed in Scopus: an eye on global research in the New Uzbekistan University.

The journey to get there? Just like yours right now.

Failed over 300 applications as a Software Engineer
Participated in over 60 Hackathons and Lost
Rejected over 20 times for startup CoMed
Demotivated seeing other people achievements

But then, I found that it’s pretty oK to fail and being unemployed

I tried myself in diverse places and positions:

1. Worked at early stage Startups (highly risky, but fun)
2. Mentored & Facilitated developers and youth both beginners and professionals (over 200K people, 0 lie)
3. Wrote pretty engaging and highly detailed tutorials about AI technologies, and tools (people LOVE, again 0 lie)
4. Authored research papers, articles, and Stories (just interesting for me storytelling)
5. Contributed to Open Source projects (just for fun, I tried at least)
6. Spoke at Conferences and to Investors (even tho I’m introverted)
7. Participated in over 60 hackathons, competitions, and challenges (could be even more)
8. Built AI-powered projects in 6 hours using AI/ML API here https://aimlapi.com/?via=ibrohim (access for free)

Of course, I can continue, but this post wasn’t about that)

My research paper: “Machine Learning Based Image Classification with COREL 1K Dataset”, now officially available on Springer here https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-97-8345-8_6 (read for free)

You can't fail if you don't quit.

Love (someone who nearly gave up).

As the 1st AI/ML API Regional Ambassador in Central Asia. I’m sharing one week free access for first-time users: Use the code IBROHIMXAIMLAPI and go here https://aimlapi.com/?via=ibrohim

🔥 Jensen Huang 𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘀𝗮𝗶𝗱: "𝗜 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗵 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗵𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗴𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝘄𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴."

Well, okay, he didn't exactly say that stuff - what he actually said was: "I hope suffering happens to you."

Umm… seems, close enough! 😂

The NVIDIA founder CEO continued: "𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘂𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗹𝘆, 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀... 𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗿, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘀𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲; 𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝘄𝗵𝗼 𝘀𝘂𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱."

This hit me so hard. 🐐 (so stay tuned, imcook.in)

In my own hackathon journey, I've come to realize that lowering my expectations has been a game-changer. I never expect to win anything. 🙈

During lablab.ai + Rhymes.AI hackathon Open Community built "PrepAlly". An Open source and AI-powered coding prep tool, offering real-time feedback, voice-guided insights ElevenLabs, and secure Clerk.com, interactive practice. Here https://lablab.ai/event/aria-multimodal-hackathon/open-community/prepally (inspired since joined Headstarter as SWE)

My only goal? 

- 𝗧𝗼 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗻𝗲𝘄. (Abdelfettah Latrache)
- To build something open source. (Gabriel Almeida)

You know what I’m saying? 

Sometimes everything goes totally wrong: 
- Spending 8 hours doing research. (something opposite to our major) 🧑‍🔬
- Taking 4 hours to fine-tune AI model. (fails due to no Google colab subscription) 🥲
- Failed presentation. (but it was fun tho, Wei B Tan) 😅
- … you name it, dear! 
(spoiler; check comments for more info)

But those are the hackathons where I learn the most. (well, I used ChatGPT, but this tool allows humanAIze AI stuff here https://humanaize.vercel.app/)

So, 𝗜 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗵 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗵𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗴𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝘄𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴, because when that happens to me, I grow the most.

Even, I failed more than 50 hackathons. But, it’s ok, tho. (untill 100, Melanie Perkins)

Now, I can access over 200 AI models with one AI/ML API here https://aimlapi.com/?via=ibrohim (use the code IBROHIMXAIMLAPI for 1 week free access 😱)

𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝗱, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗷𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗮𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘆. (sorry, I can’t tag 1K+ people here with whom I cooked cool stuff 🤧)

But, I'm ready to help 100x accelerate your journey topmate.io here topmate.io/join/abdibrokhim (I have diverse background 🦄)

For those of you who might be feeling stuck in unfulfilling careers or life paths

Forget about 10,000-hour rule. Here’s why… 🙈

The 10,000-hour rule, popularized by Malcolm Gladwell, says that becoming an expert in any field requires extensive practice and repetition.

However, David Epstein has contra-argument.

The 10,000 hours of practice work best in simple fields where feedback is immediate, and the goals are clear.

( that’s why i apply for different programs and got slapped everyday here https://www.patreon.com/collection/862594 )

Comparing yourself to younger people who aren’t you is not helpful. Everyone progresses at their own pace. 

( you need someone to guide you through the challenges? i’m here to help https://topmate.io/abdibrokhim/1291447 )

Get interested in other domains. Your world becomes a bigger world.

( i’m in my 20s, just trying to figure things out. i’m stuck, but imcook.in )

I’m just a chill guy who failed 400+ times in 6 months

it was the best thing that ever happened to my life 🙈

As a 4th-year Computer Science student at New Uzbekistan University, I originally chose my major after a random suggestion from ChatGPT.

But halfway through my junior year, I realized it was a BIG hallucination. 😂

I used to ( skip lectures ) go to the New Uzbekistan University but I got bored lmao

Then, I started building AI stuff for fun but I got bored again lol

Now, I am writing tutorials to show up how it’s easy to build stuff from scratch.

All tutorials available here for free ( spelled out ):
 - Github: https://github.com/abdibrokhim?tab=repositories
 - Medium: https://medium.com/@abdibrokhim
 - Dev: https://dev.to/abdibrokhim

PS: Open Community hosting HUGE n’GLOBAL hackathon here https://chillguy.devpost.com/ ( join A$AP 🚀 ). I promise it will be Unforgettable and full of Fun. You’ll be hacking with me 🥹. 

We provide everything for your success: 🦄
 - Live workshops ( with me and other experts )
 - Live QnA sessions ( with me and other experts )
 - Access to Discord community ( 170+ developers, founders, and just a best builders )

( we’re actively looking for sponsors and partners to make this hackathon even cooler )

[posted on 9th December]


People are wasting a lot of time searching for high quality tutorials.

Computer science and engineering ( not only ) majors are hesitant to go to hackathons or just build side projects because they can’t find good tutorials.

Honestly, the easiest way to build a project is to use ChatGPT, and… ChatGPT again.

well, okey…

But, sometimes ( mostly ) it’s not easy to prompt ChatGPT properly and get most of it.

it’s confusing, lol

So, my co-cooker @Wei B Tan and I are drastically improving the hackathon experience with theopencommunity.co . ( @Open Community on linkedin )

I’ve founded Open Community to provide world’s best comprehensive and step-by-step tutorials for builders. ( all based on real projects )

You’ll learn a lot:
 - how to build any project from scratch 
 - how to integrate different techs and tools 
 - how to make it work and deploy
 - how to film a short promo video
 - how to film presentation video
 - how to show up on Product Hunt
 - how to hype up on X
 - how to write convincing script for socials
 - how to… you name it 🙈

Shoutout to @AI/ML API, @PaperAI, and @CoMed for believing us ;)

Do you view this year as a failure?

( No, i’ve been featured on Topmate 🙈, lol ) 

Today, it’s an incredible feeling to share that I’ve been featured on Topmate.io’s landing page. 

It feels like one of those pinch-me moments that remind me why I love what I do.

Every year we work towards something.

Some days we are able to be successful, some days messed up.

Sometimes it's our turn, sometimes it isn't.

It's not a failure.

It's steps to success.

For example: Michael Jordan won 6 championships in 15 years. The other 9 years was a failure? Nah!

( It's a wrong question )

There's no failure in life.

There are both good and bad days.

And that's what life. 

Don’t quit!
