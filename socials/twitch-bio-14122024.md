## Hey, wassap?! 

### Iâ€™m Ibrohim Abdivokhidov. Or you can call me Abee for short.

Iâ€™m the founder CEO at [Open Community](https://theopencommunity.co). We build Open Source AI-powered projects and tools for people. We also write comprehensive and step-by-step tutorials on those projects and share across socials like LinkedIn, Medium, Dev, and our Discord community. So anyone, whether he or she is a beginner, a professional developer, or just a tech enthusiast, has a chance to learn how to build real stuff with AI.
